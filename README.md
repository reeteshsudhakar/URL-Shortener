# URL-Shortener
I get quite easily annoyed by the length of URLs, and I got tired of having to see ads on websites to shorten a URL. So I decided to create a URL shortener of my own! This URL shortener is a Flask app that takes in a long URL and shortens it for the user.

## Git Clone

To clone this repository, run the following line in your command line or Terminal. 

`git clone https://github.com/reeteshsudhakar/URL-shortener`

Once the code is run, a locally hosted web app will open to the home page of the shortener, prompting the user to enter a URL to be shortened!
